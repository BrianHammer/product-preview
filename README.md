## My process

Went through the documentation to setup Tailwind. Modified some files to adjust for no ./src as is expected in the default setup. Modified Tailwind.config file to match the fonts and colors as described in ./style-guide.md. Added some default styles inside of input.css to reduce lines in the index.html. Developed the mobile view first heavily using flexboxes, and then used large: to modify the code to view on large screens.

### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind

### What I learned

I learned a lot about modifying different font properties inside of tailwind. I also practiced modifying viewports for different screens. 


### Continued development

I will continue to improve my skills in adjusting to different viewports. I will also try to find a more elegant solution to adding breakpoints to prevent copying and pasting a lot.
